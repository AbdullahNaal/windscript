The syntax will be documented here.

First, declaring variables:
[DONE]	"let it be known that VAR_NAME is VALUE"
[NO]	or without a value, "let VAR_NAME be known" 
[DONE]	Letter case does not matter, except for variables' names.

Assigning a value to variables:
	"let VAR_NAME become VALUE"
Also:
	"put VALUE in VAR_NAME"

Increasing or decreasing a variable:
	"Increase/decrease VAR_NAME by VALUE"

For + and -, we will have "sum of x and y and. . ." and "difference between x and y and . . ." 

[DONE] Printing is the same as Python, but without the parentheses ().

[DONE, but "and" only] One can use "and" and "then" between statements; they will be ignored.

[DONE] "an input" will translate to input().
You can use that like "let it be known that x is an input."
or "the sum of x and an input"

[NOT YET] "an input with a prompt of "prompt"" Will offer a prompt.

[DONE] "the sum of something and something"

[DONE] "is bigger than"

[DONE] "if EXP COND STATEMENT" so you can do stuff like:
	if the sum of x and y is bigger than x print something

"If" will expect an expression to appear after it, then a conditional to follow. 

[NOT YET] The statements to execute will be between the "if" and the word "end," but that's no fun, so find something else later.

Also, "it," "they," and "them" will be substituted with the nearest main expression. For example:
	Let it be known that x is 5
	Increase it by the sum of 3 and 4
	Let it become it and print it
		all of "it" here is x.
	Main expression is the expression the statement expects.
	print(stuff): "it" will become stuff.
	let it be known that dodo is 5: "it" will become dodo
	Statements that set variables' values will set "it" to the var_name.
	Statements like print will set "it" to the expression they take.

For comments:
	Note: COMMENT. You can continue the code now.

For function declaration:
	Introducing: FUNCTION_NAME (is a noun) [of ARGUMENTS (in order)]:
				I am the STATEMENTS ON ARGUEMENTS . . .
				Pleased to meet you.
Note: One can write his own syntax for the function. Variable names are in CAPS.
	Their value is placed instead of VALUE.

Example:
	Introducing: [the] biggest of x and y and z:
			I am x if x is bigger than y and z.
			If not, then y, if y is bigger than z.
			If not, I am z.
			Pleased to meet you.

Example:
	Introducing: Draw a SHAPE with a heigh of HEIGHT and a width of WIDTH:
			...height and width can be used like this.
			Pleased to meet you.

When using a function, just call its name and put the arguements where they should be:
	Let it be known that x is the biggest of 5 and 8.
