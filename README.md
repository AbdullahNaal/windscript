# windscript

WindScript is a silly programming language "written" in python. 
It really has no purpose to exist, except for, like, having fun.

The goal is to have a language with silly syntax that requires practically none of your resources to run.
All interpreting action gets done on the server, and you get back an executable. 

This file will become well-defined later. Now, it is just a "Hallo~!" file.
