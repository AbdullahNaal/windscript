# windscript

WindScript is a silly programming language "written" in python. 
It really has no purpose to exist, except for, like, having fun.

The goal is to have a language with silly syntax that requires practically none of your resources to run.
All interpreting action gets done on the server, and you get back an executable. 

This file will become well-defined later. Now, it is just a "Hallo~!" file.

The design folder contains design related stuff, like the graphical desing or the language design (syntax.txt).
The interpreter folder contains the winderpreter.py interpreter, which translates .wind files to .wind.py.
The web folder contains the website that will call the winderpreter on the clients' scripts.
