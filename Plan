# Plan

Here are the main points we talked about:
    1. All in RAM
    2. All new code gets added to the language
    3. Multi-Server Compiling Torrent (MSCT)
    4. In Python, and gets interpreted to Python
    5. Silly, silly syntax
    6. Web app to upload script and get an executable
    7. Managing driver code form packages
    8. Mobile app for executing code and seeding
    
I feel that we should start with some syntax, interpreting it, executing it, then worrying about the RAM stuff. 
So . . . maybe syntax first?

Should we have a firm plan here, or just main points to follow?

Okay. I will start with some syntax, and see how to execute it.
