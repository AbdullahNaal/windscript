Winderpreter is a command line tool. 
It takes a .wind file that adheres to the syntax found at /design/syntax.txt,
and spits out a .wind.py python file that fulfills the script. 

To use it, write a .wind file, then open a terminal at the directory, and execute winderpreter:
"python winderpreter.py FILE_NAME.wind"

If all goes well, a FILE_NAME.wind.py will appear in the directory.

If a syntax error was encountered, winderpreter will specify the word that ticked it off.

An assertion error will be given sometimes in place of the syntax error, but it is the same.

Please check /design/syntax.txt for the supported syntax. The supported syntax will have [DONE] prefixed to it.
