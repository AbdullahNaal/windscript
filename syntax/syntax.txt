The syntax will be documented here.

First, declaring variables:
	"let it be known that VAR_NAME {'is' or 'are'} VALUE"
	or without a value, "let VAR_NAME be known" 
	Letter case does not matter, except for variables' names.

Assigning a value to variables:
	"let VAR_NAME become VALUE"

Increasing or decreasing a variable:
	"Increase/decrease VAR_NAME by VALUE"

For + and -, we will have "sum of x and y and. . ." and "difference between x and y and . . ." 

Printing is the same as Python, but without the parentheses ().

One can use "and" and "then" between statements; they will be ignored.

Also, "it," "they," and "them" will be substituted with the nearest variable. For example:
	Let it be known that x is 5
	Increase it by the sum of 3 and 4
	Let it become it and print it

For comments:
	Note: COMMENT. You can continue the code now.

For function declaration:
	Introducing: FUNCTION_NAME (is a noun) [of ARGUMENTS (in order)]:
				I am the STATEMENTS ON ARGUEMENTS . . .
				Pleased to meet you.
Note: One can write his own syntax for the function. Variable names are in CAPS.
	Their value is placed instead of VALUE.

Example:
	Introducing: [the] biggest of x and y and z:
			I am x if x is bigger than y and z.
			If not, then y, if y is bigger than z.
			If not, I am z.
			Pleased to meet you.

Example:
	Introducing: Draw a SHAPE with a HEIGHT of VALUE and a WIDTH of VALUE:
			...height and width can be used like this.
			Pleased to meet you.

When using a function, just call its name and put the arguements where they should be:
	Let it be known that x is the biggest of 5 and 8.
